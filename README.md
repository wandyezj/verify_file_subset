# verify_file_subset
VerifyFileSubset is an executable to check if a file is a subset of another file for common formats {json, xml, reg, txt}

Developed for testing purposes the idea is to be able to verify that files have a specific feature.

The standard setup is to have a file generated by automation and to have a corresponding verify file with just the feature that needs to be checked.

VerifyFileSubset is designed to make it easy to do this setup by having the verify file be in the same format as the file being checked.


Currently this only supports Json, but other formats are planned.
