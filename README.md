# verify_file_subset
VerifyFileSubset is an executable to check if a file is a subset of another file for common formats {json, xml, reg}

Developed for testing purposes the idea is to be able to verify that files have a specific feature.

The standard setup is to have a file generated by automation and to have a corresponding verify file with just the feature that needs to be checked.

VerifyFileSubset is designed to make it easy to do this setup by having the verify file be in the same format as the file being checked.


Currently this only supports {json, xml, reg}  but other formats are planned.


# What does it mean for a file to be a subset of another file?

Specific examples can be found in the UnitTest project.
In general it means that what is present in the verify file is present in the subject file.

## All
* An whitespace only verify file is considered the empty set and only matches a whitespace only subject file.

## json

* Checks that all keys and values present in the verify json are present in the subject json.
* Object key order does not matter.
* Array value order matters.
* Matching is recursive.

## xml

* Node order matters.
* Attribute order matters.
* Checks that children of a node are present.

## reg

* Checks that each registry key is present or not present as specified in the verify reg file
* Checks that each registry value with specificed data is present or not present in the subject as specified in the verify reg file.
